        companyInformation: "IQ-Option is an online investing and trading platform that allows clients to buy and sell commodities, stocks, currencies, and more. The app had a large number of trading options, but not enough users. With the help of Perfomante and creative video ads, IQ-Option wanted to show people how fun trading can be. One of the main goals was introducing trading to new potential customers, and teaching them how to invest and make a profit while having fun.",

One of the main goals was introducing trading to new potential customers, and teaching them how to invest and make a profit while having fun.",
        solution: "To overcome the challenges mentioned above, Perfomante offered IQ-Option to use native advertising. The use of native advertising in the form of creative visuals allows the brand to promote its services without making the video look like an obvious ad. Since ads put people off, we thought native ads would be the best solution. Then, the brand also received video tutorials explaining the way the platform works, as well as outlining some of the main benefits of using the platform and the results offered to the users.",
        clientFeedback: "“The work done was up to my standards. You have experience with visuals and purchasing. You understand what the user wants to see in Facebook ads and that translates in your videos. We like the idea and focus that we’ve chosen, as well as the direction we’re moving in.“",

The game consists of car tuning, racing, challenges, friends, and real cars! Our goal was to create visuals to show all the best features of the game to potential players.",
        challenges: "The main goal of the project was to invite more paying customers to download Creative Mobile apps. To do that, we had to work on new creative visuals that would entice potential players, and evoke trust and loyalty in them.",
        solution: "Perfomante came up with a number of videos that conveyed the competitive spirit of the game in an exciting way. The footage used in the videos did not come from original gameplay. The goal of that was to attract more attention from viewers. Finally, Perfomante suggested some new ideas that have not been tested before.",
        clientFeedback: "You’ve got great taste in creatives. That’s for sure! Video creatives produced by Perfomante were simply astonishing in both production quality and creative ideas behind them. Being KPI-centric, video creatives achieved expected results in both tests and UA campaigns.",

        companyInformation: "Avatarify is a mobile app that allows its users to transform simple pictures into videos. Upload a photo of a celebrity and make them wish your friend a happy birthday, or make your dog talk on the screen of your smartphone. Avatarify is quite popular because the results are outstanding. Users download the app to have a laugh with their friends and make a funny video. People appreciate the quality of animation and the audio library. Even though the app has lots of downloads, it struggles with its retention rate. People download Avatarify to use it once or twice and never come back. Adding new features and finding repeating patterns among users can help us solve this problem.",
        challenges: "There were three main goals on this project. First, the brand needed to increase the overall number of app downloads. Then, we needed to launch the viral growth of the app in new countries. Finally, it was very important to differentiate the brand from its competitors and find a unique selling proposition that would convince people to choose Avatarify.",
        solution: "With Avatarify, the core product feature speaks for itself. The videos provide an instant “wow-effect” that leaves an impression on the audience. Our job was to capture the app’s capabilities and present them in a comprehensive way. To help the brand, we created videos that catch the viewer’s attention with their quality. In addition to that, we showed potential users what they could use the app for. For instance, we included videos of babies and dogs “talking”. ",

There, players can create their own characters, customize their personality and appearance, build a house, meet other players, play games, participate in challenges and events, and complete quests. One of the main selling points of the game is character customization. Many players enjoy that part of the game the most. With Perfomante’s help, Avakin was hoping to create videos that would perform well and appeal to their audience. The ultimate goal was to invite former players to come back, and find new players. The target audience consisted of players who like to express themselves through customization and creativity.",
        challenges: "The goal for the next few months is to launch the retargeting process and gain the largest number of players for high season. The visual part of the ads is meant to entice new players to make the purchase and start a new game.",
        solution: "To help Avakin overcome the aforementioned challenges, Perfomante created videos that introduce the newest updates and features of the app to potential players. These videos uncover new locations, outfits, hairstyles, and more. ",
